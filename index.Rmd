*Click on each state to display the amount of reported Releases of TRI Chemicals to the Environment in* **million pounds**


```{r polmap,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
# Create a dataframe
pol<-read.csv("./pollution.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
pol2<-cbind(pol,state.name,state.abb)
pol2<-mutate(pol2,Pounds_Millions=round(Pounds/1000000,1))
# Create hover text
pol2$hover <- with(pol2, paste("TRI (million pounds)",'<br>',state.name))
# Make state borders white
borders <- list(color = toRGB("blue"))
# Set up some mapping options
map_options <- list(
  scope = 'usa',
  projection = list(type = 'albers usa'),
  showlakes = TRUE,
  lakecolor = toRGB('white')
)
plot_ly(z = ~pol2$Pounds_Millions, text = ~pol2$hover, locations = ~pol2$state.abb, 
        type = 'choropleth', locationmode = 'USA-states', 
        color = pol2$Pounds_Millions, colors = 'Reds', marker = list(line = borders)) %>%
  layout(title = 'TRI Releases In US', geo = map_options)
```

Note: In general chemicals covered by the TRI (Toxic Release Inventory) Program are those that cause one or more of the following:
